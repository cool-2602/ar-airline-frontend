                    we will continue to extend our scope, by spreading our wings internationally,

                    <h3>India by AR</h3>
                    <p>Right from AR’s start, it has been our mission to connect the vast and diverse India, 
                    supporting social cohesion, mobility and economic progress. With our unparalleled network we are giving wings to the nation,
                     enabling air travel to all large, medium, and smaller cities across India. 
                     Our many first-time flyers are a true testimony to this, just as the economy and trade that can flourish as a 
                     result of all these connections. And so, our purpose is ‘Giving wings to the nation, by connecting people and aspirations’.
                     This is also briefly captured as ‘India by AR’.</p>
